# My-Refocus-Assignments

Hello I am Kurt Ivan C. Quejada, currently learning Web Developer course at Refocus

My Hobbies are playing games, watching and reading, but since I started to learn JavaScript it also became one of my habbits to learn JavaScript

My goals for this year is to use all of my knowledge in coding and get a job for web developer before 2022 ends

I want to become a Web Developer because I want to start my career and use my career to get everything I want, I also want to become a Web Developer so that I can work remotely
