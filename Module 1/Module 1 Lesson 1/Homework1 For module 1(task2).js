// Task 2 Saving app

//You are now working on a finance app that helps users save money. 
//To encourage users to continue saving, you are adding a feature to show how much money they have already saved.

//Suppose that Sam wants to save ₱10,000 and has already saved ₱7,500. 
//Use console.log and variables to output the following in JavaScript:

let GoalToSave = 10000
let HaveSave = 7500
let Percent = 100

let x = HaveSave / GoalToSave
let PercentageOfReachingHisGoal = x * Percent

console.log(`Sam has already reached his ${PercentageOfReachingHisGoal}% of his goal from saving up to ₱${GoalToSave}`)
// “Thank you for your discipline and hardwork, Sam! You are now 25% away from your goal of saving ₱10,000.
